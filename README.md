# Text-Mining-Sentiment-Analysis
Text Mining: Sentiment Analysis on tweets related to COVID-19. 
I collected various tweets on COVID-19 using the 2 datasets mentioned here. Then, I performed exploratory analysis and feature selection on that data to identify the features on the basis of which sentiment analysis can be carried out on those tweets. This involved filtering stop words, generating word clouds, etc., and finally creating different models on the given dataset using ML Algorithms such as ADABoost, decision trees, and XGBoost. 
Lastly, I carried out different statistical tests on the same data such as a chi-squared test, t-test, Friedman test, etc. to analyze the performance of the data models created.
